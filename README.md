# About the project
### JetRunner FPS Unity 3D Game
In this project I was focused on movement systems, I wanted to make it dynamic and vertical, and I did. You can slide by wall from each side of the character without any limits, and as a bonus you have jet-flying for a fast relocation across the map. To made a game on this basis I created zombie waves and station to defend and radiation to avoid.
## How to use
Main script of this project is CustomGravity that provides wallrun, you need only some wall/obstacle and this script on your character and you can start your wallrun.
